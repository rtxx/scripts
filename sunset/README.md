sunset is a simple script that changes desktop theme from a list of avaiable themes. It changes automatically i3 and i3status configs, Xresources, dunst, GTK and QT.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

sunset needs ```xsettingsd jq feh```
jq to parse the JSON theme file, xsettingsd for GTK themes and feh for the wallpaper
* jq
  ```sh
  pacman -Syu jq xsettingsd feh
  ```

### Installation

1. Download it [here](https://github.com/rtxx/scripts/tree/main/sunset)
2. Run it
   ```sh
   bash sunset -h
   ```
Make sure its inside a folder with the directory 'themes', or else it wont work.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

sunset can be used to 

* Change the theme
  ```sh
  bash sunset -a nord
  ```
* List avaiable themes
  ```sh
  bash sunset -l
     ```
* For more uses do
  ```sh
  bash sunset -h
     ```
### Notes
* Please backup all the configs files before running. Please inspect the script before running because it **will** change several files and overwrite your configuration.
* For the script to work, i3 and i3status must have the following folder structure:
```
i3
  | config.d
    | theme.conf
    | main.conf
  | config
  | makeconfig
```
``` makeconfig ``` _glues_ the ```main.conf``` and ```theme.conf``` and replaces ```config```. Same for i3status.
Check my i3 personal repo for more information.
* I personally use base16 based themes for i3 and i3status, so it needs more testing for other types of themes (I think is fine but YMMV).
* rxvt wont update on the fly its colors, please use ```kitty``` or other terminal that supports it. There≈õ also [urxvt-config-reload](https://github.com/regnarg/urxvt-config-reload) if you need it.
